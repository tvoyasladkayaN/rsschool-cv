###About me
**********
_Hello, I am Nina and six month ago, I had no idea how the frontend differs from the backend. But the book on the basics of HTML got into my hands, and I realized, that I had found a case that I was really interested in. Sinse then, all my free time has been devoted to the theory and practtice of frontend development. This is the buisness in which I would like to develop further._
